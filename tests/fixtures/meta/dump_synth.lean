/- Emits the tier-1 typeclass-SYNTHESIS query corpus as canonical JSONL
(M4a plan-4 spec § The gate). Sibling of `dump_defeq.lean`: same
canonical expr/level scheme, same canonicalization rules, same
hermetic contract — runs with `LEAN_PATH` set to this directory so
`import Synth0` resolves to the committed fixture and NOTHING else.
`Synth0` is prelude-mode and import-free, so the oracle environment
here is exactly the environment `crates/leanr_meta/tests/
oracle_synth.rs` replays from `Synth0.olean`.

The canonical expr/level scheme and every canonicalization rule
(binder names erased, `MData` erased, mvars/fvars numbered in
first-occurrence order WITHIN one record, literals as decimal strings,
binder-info kind letters) are documented in `dump_defeq.lean`'s module
header — that file is the authoritative statement; the encoders below
(`biStr`/`encLevel`/`EncSt`/`encExpr`) are copied from it VERBATIM so
the two corpora share one scheme by construction. They are duplicated
rather than factored because Lean has no shared-module story here that
does not break the "import ONLY the fixture" hermeticity contract (a
common `Enc.lean` would have to live in this directory and would then
be importable — and thus a second module in the oracle environment —
unless built separately; not worth it for ~70 lines).

Record shape (one per curated query):
  { "id"   : "<tag>/synth/<i>"
  , "q"    : "synth"
  , "goal" : <E>                     -- the synthesis goal type
  , "mvars": [ {"i":<N>, "t":<E>} ]  -- goal mvars: canonical index + TYPE
  , "ok"   : true|false              -- oracle verdict
  , "val"  : <E>                     -- present iff ok; the instance TERM
  , "near_budget": true|false        -- see below
  }

`mvars` exists because the canonical expr scheme carries no mvar-type
field, yet the replay side must DECLARE every goal metavariable before
calling `synth_instance` (a goal mvar that is merely interned but not
declared makes leanr's `synth_pending` raise `MetaError::MVar`).
`dump_defeq.lean`'s `defeq_mvar` records dodge this by having the gate
re-derive the type from the structurally-parallel `b` side; a
synthesis record has no such parallel side, so the type is emitted
EXPLICITLY here. Indices are numbered in the SAME `EncSt` that
numbered `goal`, so they line up with the `{"k":"mvar","i":N}` nodes
inside it.

`near_budget` implements the global determinism constraint ("queries
near any step/depth budget are recorded and excluded from the gate").
leanr counts deterministic `MetaCtx::step`s and the oracle counts
heartbeats, so the two budgets are not comparable — what this flag
records is the ORACLE's own margin: heartbeats consumed by this single
`synthInstance?` call as a fraction of `Core.Context.maxHeartbeats`.
Anything over 20% is flagged, and `oracle_synth.rs` skips it: a query
that close to the oracle's own limit is one whose recorded verdict
could flip on an unrelated performance change, which is exactly the
kind of record a regression gate must not contain. Every curated query
below is tiny, so the expected flag is `false` throughout — the field
is the mechanism, not a current exclusion.

`synthInstance?` (not `synthInstance`) is called: it returns
`Option Expr`, so an honest "no instance" is `none` (-> `ok:false`)
and is not conflated with the `throwFailedToSynthesize` that
`synthInstance` also raises after an `isDefEqStuck`
(`SynthInstance.lean:1024-1030`). Any exception that DOES escape is
emitted as an `"exc"` record instead of a query record, and such a
query is not part of the committed gate — a corpus entry must be one
the oracle answered cleanly.

/-- The curated synthesis corpus. `(tag, index, goal-builder)`; the
builder runs in `MetaM` so a query can mint a metavariable (the stuck

`dump_defeq.lean`'s `constant/kind/index` id contract.

What each entry exercises (task B7's brief):
* `simple`      — one-step resolution against a concrete instance.
* `diamond`     — `Mul N` is derivable directly (`instMulN`) AND via
                  `Semigroup.toMul instSemigroupN` AND via
                  `Monoid.toSemigroup`; the search must pick ONE
                  deterministic derivation, which the committed `val`
                  pins. (Redundant-path sense — `Synth0.lean`'s own
                  comment explains why the superclass chain is linear.)
* `superclass`  — resolving the class that OWNS the projection
                  instances (`Semigroup N`, `Monoid N`).
* `chain`       — subgoal chaining through the parametrized
                  `instAddProd`/`instChainProd` (one and two levels
                  deep), so the committed `val` carries the recursively
                  synthesized sub-instances as arguments.
* `default`     — the `@[default_instance]`-tagged `instOfNN`. NOTE:
                  `synthInstance` itself never CONSULTS the default-
                  instance table (that is the elaborator's
                  `synthesizeUsingDefault`, M4b); what this pins is
                  that a default-tagged instance is still an ordinary
                  instance for resolution, and that the extra
                  `defaultInstanceExtension` entry does not perturb it.
* `priority`    — `Pri N`: `instPriLow` is declared LATER but at LOWER
                  priority, so declaration order and priority order
                  disagree and the committed `val` (`instPriHigh`)
                  distinguishes them.
* `negative`    — `NoInst N`: no candidate at all -> `ok:false`.
* `negativeSub` — `Chain (Prod NoBase N)`: fails only AFTER
                  `instChainProd` was applied and its first subgoal
                  failed.
* `mvarGoal`    — `OfN ?n N` with `?n : N` an UNASSIGNED mvar minted
                  OUTSIDE the search. Unlike `stuck` below, `?n` sits
                  in a position the search never needs to ASSIGN (the
                  candidate `instOfNN`'s own `n` binder becomes a fresh
                  INNER mvar, and it is that inner one that gets
                  assigned `?n`), so the oracle answers cleanly and the
                  answer term still MENTIONS `?n`. This is the record
                  that exercises the `mvars` field.
* `stuck`       — `Add ?a` with `?a` an UNASSIGNED mvar minted OUTSIDE
                  the search. `synthInstanceCore?` runs `main` under
                  `withNewMCtxDepth`, so `?a` is read-only there and
                  `isDefEqStuckEx := true` makes the first unification
                  throw. See this file's header on `"exc"` records. -/
